          <h2>About Dr. Serena Blake</h2>
          <p>
            Finding time and opportunities to care for ourselves can be incredibly challenging in todayâ€™s busy and demanding world. I believe therapy offers a dedicated space for self-care, providing the support and tools needed to improve this essential practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therapy can help individuals identify and clarify their goals, values, and the various elements that contribute to their well-being, recognizing that these aspects vary from person to person.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am dedicated to supporting this journey by offering active listening, psychological knowledge, empathy, compassion, and insights into behavioral patterns and tendencies. I hold a Psy.D in Clinical Psychology from the California Institute of Integral Studies.
          </p>
          <p>
            My therapeutic approach blends psychodynamic and humanistic practices with mindfulness, existentialism, and evidence-based strategies. Whether in-person or virtual, I strive to create a warm, supportive space for healing and growth.
